        <Description>&lt;b&gt;Method/Function:&lt;/b&gt; complexity of the method/function expressed as the number of independent control flow paths in it. It represents a lower bound for the number of possible execution paths in the source code and at the same time it is an upper bound for the minimum number of test cases needed for achieving full branch test coverage. The value of the metric is calculated as the number of the following instructions plus 1: if, for, while, except and conditional expression. Moreover, logical quot;andquot; and logical quot;orquot; expressions also add 1 to the value because their short-circuit evaluation can cause branching depending on the first operand. The following instructions are not included: else, try, finally.</Description>
