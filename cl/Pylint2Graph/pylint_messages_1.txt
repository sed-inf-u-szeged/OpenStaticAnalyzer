:typecheck:c-extension-no-member (I1101): *%s %r has not %r member%s, but source is unavailable. Consider adding this module to extension-pkg-whitelist if you want to perform analysis based on run-time introspection of living objects.*
  Used when a variable is accessed for non-existent member of C extension. Due
  to unavailability of source static analysis is impossible, but it may be
  performed by introspecting living objects in run-time.
:basic:literal-comparison (R0123): *Comparison to literal*
  Used when comparing an object to a literal, which is usually what you do not
  want to do, since you can compare to a different literal than what was
  expected altogether.
:classes:no-self-use (R0201): *Method could be a function*
  Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as
  a function.
:classes:no-classmethod-decorator (R0202): *Consider using a decorator instead of calling classmethod*
  Used when a class method is defined without using the decorator syntax.
:classes:no-staticmethod-decorator (R0203): *Consider using a decorator instead of calling staticmethod*

  Used when a cyclic import between two or more modules is detected.
:similarities:duplicate-code (R0801): *Similar lines in %s files*
  Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file.
  This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this
  duplication.
:design:too-many-ancestors (R0901): *Too many ancestors (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many parent classes, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:design:too-many-instance-attributes (R0902): *Too many instance attributes (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many instance attributes, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:design:too-few-public-methods (R0903): *Too few public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.
:design:too-many-public-methods (R0904): *Too many public methods (%s/%s)*
  Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a
  simpler (and so easier to use) class.
:design:too-many-return-statements (R0911): *Too many return statements (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many return statement, making it hard
  to follow.
:design:too-many-branches (R0912): *Too many branches (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many branches, making it hard to
  follow.
:design:too-many-arguments (R0913): *Too many arguments (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method takes too many arguments.
:design:too-many-locals (R0914): *Too many local variables (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many local variables.
:design:too-many-statements (R0915): *Too many statements (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or method has too many statements. You should then split
  it in smaller functions / methods.
:design:too-many-boolean-expressions (R0916): *Too many boolean expressions in if statement (%s/%s)*
  Used when a if statement contains too many boolean expressions.
:refactoring:consider-merging-isinstance (R1701): *Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(%s, (%s))*
  Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one.
:refactoring:too-many-nested-blocks (R1702): *Too many nested blocks (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the
  code less understandable and maintainable.
:refactoring:simplifiable-if-statement (R1703): *The if statement can be replaced with %s*
  Used when an if statement can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.
:refactoring:redefined-argument-from-local (R1704): *Redefining argument with the local name %r*
  Used when a local name is redefining an argument, which might suggest a
  potential error. This is taken in account only for a handful of name binding
  operations, such as for iteration, with statement assignment and exception
  handler assignment.
:refactoring:no-else-return (R1705): *Unnecessary "else" after "return"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.
:refactoring:consider-using-ternary (R1706): *Consider using ternary (%s)*
  Used when one of known pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:refactoring:trailing-comma-tuple (R1707): *Disallow trailing comma tuple*
  In Python, a tuple is actually created by the comma symbol, not by the
  parentheses. Unfortunately, one can actually create a tuple by misplacing a
  trailing comma, which can lead to potential weird bugs in your code. You
  should always use parentheses explicitly for creating a tuple. This message
  can't be emitted when using Python < 3.0.
:refactoring:stop-iteration-return (R1708): *Do not raise StopIteration in generator, use return statement instead*
  According to PEP479, the raise of StopIteration to end the loop of a generator
  may lead to hard to find bugs. This PEP specify that raise StopIteration has
  to be replaced by a simple return statement. This message can't be emitted
  when using Python < 3.0.
:refactoring:simplify-boolean-expression (R1709): *Boolean expression may be simplified to %s*
  Emitted when redundant pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:refactoring:inconsistent-return-statements (R1710): *Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should.*
  According to PEP8, if any return statement returns an expression, any return
  statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return
  None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the
  function (if reachable).
:basic:unreachable (W0101): *Unreachable code*
  Used when there is some code behind a "return" or "raise" statement, which
  will never be accessed.
:basic:dangerous-default-value (W0102): *Dangerous default value %s as argument*
  Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary is detected in a default value
  for an argument.
:basic:pointless-statement (W0104): *Statement seems to have no effect*
  Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.
:basic:pointless-string-statement (W0105): *String statement has no effect*
  Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).
  This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily
  disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of
  comments.
:basic:expression-not-assigned (W0106): *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing*
  Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.
  Probably something else was intended.
:basic:unnecessary-pass (W0107): *Unnecessary pass statement*
  Used when a "pass" statement that can be avoided is encountered.
:basic:unnecessary-lambda (W0108): *Lambda may not be necessary*
  Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same
  argument list as the lambda itself; such lambda expressions are in all but a
  few cases replaceable with the function being called in the body of the
  lambda.
:basic:duplicate-key (W0109): *Duplicate key %r in dictionary*
  Used when a dictionary expression binds the same key multiple times.
:basic:deprecated-lambda (W0110): *map/filter on lambda could be replaced by comprehension*
  Used when a lambda is the first argument to "map" or "filter". It could be
  clearer as a list comprehension or generator expression. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python >= 3.0.
:basic:assign-to-new-keyword (W0111): *Name %s will become a keyword in Python %s*
  Used when assignment will become invalid in future Python release due to
  introducing new keyword.
:basic:useless-else-on-loop (W0120): *Else clause on loop without a break statement*
  Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break
  statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as
  the loop itself.
:basic:exec-used (W0122): *Use of exec*
  Used when you use the "exec" statement (function for Python 3), to discourage
  its usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it!
:basic:eval-used (W0123): *Use of eval*
  Used when you use the "eval" function, to discourage its usage. Consider using
  `ast.literal_eval` for safely evaluating strings containing Python expressions
  from untrusted sources.
:basic:confusing-with-statement (W0124): *Following "as" with another context manager looks like a tuple.*
  Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses
  name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as a,
  b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager returns
  a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context manager.
:basic:using-constant-test (W0125): *Using a conditional statement with a constant value*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) uses a constant value
  for its test. This might not be what the user intended to do.
:basic:lost-exception (W0150): *%s statement in finally block may swallow exception*
  Used when a break or a return statement is found inside the finally clause of
  a try...finally block: the exceptions raised in the try clause will be
  silently swallowed instead of being re-raised.
:basic:assert-on-tuple (W0199): *Assert called on a 2-uple. Did you mean 'assert x,y'?*
  A call of assert on a tuple will always evaluate to true if the tuple is not
  empty, and will always evaluate to false if it is.
:classes:attribute-defined-outside-init (W0201): *Attribute %r defined outside __init__*
  Used when an instance attribute is defined outside the __init__ method.

  ancestors for the analysed class.
:classes:useless-super-delegation (W0235): *Useless super delegation in method %r*
  Used whenever we can detect that an overridden method is useless, relying on
  super() delegation to do the same thing as another method from the MRO.
:format:unnecessary-semicolon (W0301): *Unnecessary semicolon*
  Used when a statement is ended by a semi-colon (";"), which isn't necessary
  (that's python, not C ;).
:format:bad-indentation (W0311): *Bad indentation. Found %s %s, expected %s*
  Used when an unexpected number of indentation's tabulations or spaces has been
  found.
:format:mixed-indentation (W0312): *Found indentation with %ss instead of %ss*
  Used when there are some mixed tabs and spaces in a module.
:format:lowercase-l-suffix (W0332): *Use of "l" as long integer identifier*

:logging:logging-not-lazy (W1201): *Specify string format arguments as logging function parameters*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string % (format_args...))". Such calls should leave string
  interpolation to the logging method itself and be written "logging.<logging
  method>(format_string, format_args...)" so that the program may avoid
  incurring the cost of the interpolation in those cases in which no message
  will be logged. For more, see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0282/.
:logging:logging-format-interpolation (W1202): *Use % formatting in logging functions and pass the % parameters as arguments*
  Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.<logging

  when using Python < 2.7.
:string:missing-format-argument-key (W1303): *Missing keyword argument %r for format string*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string that uses named fields doesn't receive one
  or more required keywords. This message can't be emitted when using Python <

  Used when a PEP 3101 format string that uses named fields is used with an
  argument that is not required by the format string. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python < 2.7.
:string:format-combined-specification (W1305): *Format string contains both automatic field numbering and manual field specification*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string contains both automatic field numbering
  (e.g. '{}') and manual field specification (e.g. '{0}'). This message can't be
  emitted when using Python < 2.7.
:string:missing-format-attribute (W1306): *Missing format attribute %r in format specifier %r*
  Used when a PEP 3101 format string uses an attribute specifier ({0.length}),
  but the argument passed for formatting doesn't have that attribute. This

  See http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open.
:stdlib:boolean-datetime (W1502): *Using datetime.time in a boolean context.*
  Using datetime.time in a boolean context can hide subtle bugs when the time
  they represent matches midnight UTC. This behaviour was fixed in Python 3.5.
  See http://bugs.python.org/issue13936 for reference. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python >= 3.5.
:stdlib:redundant-unittest-assert (W1503): *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r*

  the target function being passed. By default, the first parameter is the group
  param, not the target param.
:stdlib:shallow-copy-environ (W1507): *Using copy.copy(os.environ). Use os.environ.copy() instead. *
  os.environ is not a dict object but proxy object, so shallow copy has still
  effects on original object. See https://bugs.python.org/issue15373 for

  Used when an __idiv__ method is defined. Using `__itruediv__` and
  setting__idiv__ = __itruediv__ should be preferred.(method is not used by
  Python 3).
:python3:rdiv-method (W1644): *__rdiv__ method defined*
  Used when a __rdiv__ method is defined. Using `__rtruediv__` and
  setting__rdiv__ = __rtruediv__ should be preferred.(method is not used by
  Python 3).
:python3:exception-message-attribute (W1645): *Exception.message removed in Python 3*
  Used when the message attribute is accessed on an Exception. Use
  str(exception) instead.
:python3:invalid-str-codec (W1646): *non-text encoding used in str.decode*
  Used when using str.encode or str.decode with a non-text encoding. Use codecs
  module to handle arbitrary codecs.
:python3:sys-max-int (W1647): *sys.maxint removed in Python 3*
  Used when accessing sys.maxint. Use sys.maxsize instead.
:python3:bad-python3-import (W1648): *Module moved in Python 3*
  Used when importing a module that no longer exists in Python 3.
:python3:deprecated-string-function (W1649): *Accessing a deprecated function on the string module*
  Used when accessing a string function that has been deprecated in Python 3.
:python3:deprecated-str-translate-call (W1650): *Using str.translate with deprecated deletechars parameters*
  Used when using the deprecated deletechars parameters from str.translate. Use
  re.sub to remove the desired characters.
:python3:deprecated-itertools-function (W1651): *Accessing a deprecated function on the itertools module*
  Used when accessing a function on itertools that has been removed in Python 3.
:python3:deprecated-types-field (W1652): *Accessing a deprecated fields on the types module*
  Used when accessing a field on types that has been removed in Python 3.
:python3:next-method-defined (W1653): *next method defined*
  Used when a next method is defined that would be an iterator in Python 2 but
  is treated as a normal function in Python 3.
:python3:dict-items-not-iterating (W1654): *dict.items referenced when not iterating*
  Used when dict.items is referenced in a non-iterating context (returns an
  iterator in Python 3).
:python3:dict-keys-not-iterating (W1655): *dict.keys referenced when not iterating*
  Used when dict.keys is referenced in a non-iterating context (returns an
  iterator in Python 3).
:python3:dict-values-not-iterating (W1656): *dict.values referenced when not iterating*
  Used when dict.values is referenced in a non-iterating context (returns an
  iterator in Python 3).
:python3:deprecated-operator-function (W1657): *Accessing a removed attribute on the operator module*
  Used when accessing a field on operator module that has been removed in Python
  3.
:python3:deprecated-urllib-function (W1658): *Accessing a removed attribute on the urllib module*
  Used when accessing a field on urllib module that has been removed or moved in
  Python 3.
:python3:xreadlines-attribute (W1659): *Accessing a removed xreadlines attribute*
  Used when accessing the xreadlines() function on a file stream, removed in
  Python 3.
:python3:deprecated-sys-function (W1660): *Accessing a removed attribute on the sys module*
  Used when accessing a field on sys module that has been removed in Python 3.
:python3:exception-escape (W1661): *Using an exception object that was bound by an except handler*
  Emitted when using an exception, that was bound in an except handler, outside
  of the except handler. On Python 3 these exceptions will be deleted once they
  get out of the except handler.
:python3:comprehension-escape (W1662): *Using a variable that was bound inside a comprehension*
  Emitted when using a variable, that was bound in a comprehension handler,
  outside of the comprehension itself. On Python 3 these variables will be
  deleted outside of the comprehension.
