This only applies to function declarations; named or anonymous function expressions can occur anywhere an expression is permitted. A variable declaration is permitted anywhere a statement can go, even nested deeply inside other blocks. This is often undesirable due to variable hoisting, and moving declarations to the root of the program or function body can increase clarity. Note that block bindings (let, const) are not hoisted and therefore they are not affected by this rule.</Description>

        <Description> One of the confusing aspects of JavaScript is that any function may or may not return a value at any point in time. When a function exits without any return statement executing, the function returns undefined. Similarly, calling return without specifying any value will cause the function to return undefined. Only when return is called with a value is there a change in the function&apos;s return value. Unlike statically-typed languages that will catch when a function doesn&apos;t return the type of data expected, JavaScript has no such checks, meaning that it&apos;s easy to make mistakes such as this: Here, one branch of the function returns true, a Boolean value, while the other exits without specifying any value (and so returns undefined). This may be an indicator of a coding error, especially if this pattern is found in larger functions.</Description>

Sometimes people change the behavior of these native objects in ways that break the assumptions made about them in other parts of the code. For example here we are overriding a builtin method that will then affect all Objects, even other builtins. A common suggestion to avoid this problem would be to wrap the inside of the for loop with users.hasOwnProperty(id).

        <Description> There are three primitive types in JavaScript that have wrapper objects: string, number, and boolean. These are represented by the constructors String, Number, and Boolean, respectively. The primitive wrapper types are used whenever one of these primitive values is read, providing them with object-like capabilities such as methods. Behind the scenes, an object of the associated wrapper type is created and then destroyed, which is why you can call methods on primitive values, such as: Behind the scenes in this example, a String object is constructed. The substring() method exists on String.prototype and so is accessible to the string instance. It&apos;s also possible to manually create a new wrapper instance: Although possible, there aren&apos;t any good reasons to use these primitive wrappers as constructors. They tend to confuse other developers more than anything else because they seem like they should act as primitives, but they do not. For example: The first problem is that primitive wrapper objects are, in fact, objects. That means typeof will return &quot;object&quot; instead of &quot;string&quot;, &quot;number&quot;, or &quot;boolean&quot;. The second problem comes with boolean objects. Every object is truthy, that means an instance of Boolean always resolves to true even when its actual value is false. For these reasons, it&apos;s considered a best practice to avoid using primitive wrapper types with new.</Description>

        <Description> When using the parseInt() function it is common to omit the second argument, the radix, and let the function try to determine from the first argument what type of number it is. By default, parseInt() will autodetect decimal and hexadecimal (via 0x prefix). Prior to ECMAScript 5, parseInt() also autodetected octal literals, which caused problems because many developers assumed a leading 0 would be ignored. This confusion led to the suggestion that you always use the radix parameter to parseInt() to eliminate unintended consequences. So instead of doing this: Do this: ECMAScript 5 changed the behavior of parseInt() so that it no longer autodetects octal literals and instead treats them as decimal literals. However, the differences between hexadecimal and decimal interpretation of the first parameter causes many developers to continue using the radix parameter to ensure the string is interpreted in the intended way. On the other hand, if the code is targeting only ES5-compliant environments passing the radix 10 may be redundant. In such a case you might want to disallow using such a radix.</Description>

Compare to the other way of arranging the operands: This typically reads, &quot;color is red&quot;, which is arguably a more natural way to describe the comparison. Proponents of Yoda conditions highlight that it is impossible to mistakenly use = instead of == because you cannot assign to a literal value. Doing so will cause a syntax error and you will be informed of the mistake early on. This practice was therefore very common in early programming where tools were not yet available. Opponents of Yoda conditions point out that tooling has made us better programmers because tools will catch the mistaken use of = instead of == (ESLint will catch this for you).

        <Description> The process.exit() method in Node.js is used to immediately stop the Node.js process and exit. This is a dangerous operation because it can occur in any method at any point in time, potentially stopping a Node.js application completely when an error occurs. For example: This code could appear in any module and will stop the entire application when somethingBadHappened is truthy. This doesn&apos;t give the application any chance to respond to the error. It&apos;s usually better to throw an error and allow the application to handle it appropriately: By throwing an error in this way, other parts of the application have an opportunity to handle the error rather than stopping the application altogether. If the error bubbles all the way up to the process without being handled, then the process will exit and a non-zero exit code will returned, so the end result is the same.</Description>

        <Description> In Node.js, most I/O is done through asynchronous methods. However, there are often synchronous versions of the asynchronous methods. For example, fs.exists() and fs.existsSync(). In some contexts, using synchronous operations is okay (if, as with ESLint, you are writing a command line utility). However, in other contexts the use of synchronous operations is considered a bad practice that should be avoided. For example, if you are running a high-travel web server on Node.js, you should consider carefully if you want to allow any synchronous operations that could lock up the server.</Description>

        <Description> Brace style is closely related to indent style in programming and describes the placement of curly braces relative to their control statement and body. There are probably a dozen, if not more, brace styles in the world. The one true brace style is one of the most common brace styles in JavaScript, in which the opening curly brace of a block is placed on the same line as its corresponding statement or declaration. For example: One common variant of one true brace style is called Stroustrup, in which the else statements in an if-else construct, as well as catch and finally, must be on its own line after the preceding closing brace, as in this example: Another style is called Allman, in which all the braces are expected to be on their own lines without any extra indentation: While no style is considered better than the other, most developers agree that having a consistent style throughout a project is important for its long-term maintainability.</Description>

        <Description> There are two ways of defining functions in JavaScript: function declarations and function expressions. Declarations have the function keyword first, followed by a name, followed by its arguments and the function body, such as: Equivalent function expressions begin with the var keyword, followed by a name, and then the function itself, such as: The primary difference between function declarations and function expressions is that declarations are hoisted to the top of the scope in which they are defined, which allows you to write code that uses the function before the declaration. For example: Although this code might seem like an error, it actually works fine because JavaScript engines hoist the function declarations to the top of the scope. That means this code is treated as if the declaration came before the invocation. For function expressions, you must define the function before it is used, otherwise it causes an error. Example: In this case, doSomething() is undefined at the time of invocation and so causes a runtime error. Due to these different behaviors, it is common to have guidelines as to which style of function should be used. There is really no correct or incorrect choice here, it is just a preference.</Description>

        <Description> JavaScript has a lot of language features, and not everyone likes every features. As a result, some projects choose to disallow the use of certain language features altogether. For instance, you might decide to disallow the use of try-catch or class. Rather than creating separate rules for every language feature you want to turn off, this rule allows you to configure the syntax elements you want to restrict use of. These elements are represented by their ESTree node types. For example, a function declaration is represented by FunctionDeclaration and the with statement is represented by WithStatement. You may find the full list of AST node names you can use on GitHub and use the online parser to see what type of nodes your code consists of.</Description>

        <Description> As far as naming conventions for identifiers go, dangling underscores may be the most polarizing in JavaScript. Dangling underscores are underscores at either the beginning or end of an identifier, such as: There is actually a long history of using dangling underscores to indicate &quot;private&quot; members of objects in JavaScript (though JavaScript doesn&apos;t have truly private members, this convention served as a warning). This began with SpiderMonkey adding nonstandard methods such as __defineGetter__(). The intent with the underscores was to make it obvious that this method was special in some way. Since that time, using a single underscore prefix has become popular as a way to indicate &quot;private&quot; members of objects. Whether or not you choose to allow dangling underscores in identifiers is purely a convention and has no effect on performance, readability, or complexity. It&apos;s purely a preference.</Description>

        <Description> Object literal property names can be defined in two ways: using literals or using strings. For example, these two objects are equivalent: In many cases, it doesn&apos;t matter if you choose to use an identifier instead of a string or vice-versa. Even so, you might decide to enforce a consistent style in your code. There are, however, some occasions when you must use quotes: Another example where quotes do matter is when using numeric literals as property keys: This may look alright at first sight, but this code in fact throws a syntax error in ECMAScript 5 strict mode. This happens because 1e2 and 100 are coerced into strings before getting used as the property name. Both String(1e2) and String(100) happen to be equal to &quot;100&quot;, which causes the &quot;Duplicate data property in object literal not allowed in strict mode&quot; error. Issues like that can be tricky to debug, so some prefer to require quotes around all property names.</Description>

        <Description> JavaScript is unique amongst the C-like languages in that it doesn&apos;t require semicolons at the end of each statement. In many cases, the JavaScript engine can determine that a semicolon should be in a certain spot and will automatically add it. This feature is known as automatic semicolon insertion (ASI) and is considered one of the more controversial features of JavaScript. For example, the following lines are both valid: On the first line, the JavaScript engine will automatically insert a semicolon, so this is not considered a syntax error. The JavaScript engine still knows how to interpret the line and knows that the line end indicates the end of the statement. In the debate over ASI, there are generally two schools of thought. The first is that we should treat ASI as if it didn&apos;t exist and always include semicolons manually. The rationale is that it&apos;s easier to always include semicolons than to try to remember when they are or are not required, and thus decreases the possibility of introducing an error. However, the ASI mechanism can sometimes be tricky to people who are using semicolons. For example, consider this code: This may look like a return statement that returns an object literal, however, the JavaScript engine will interpret this code as: Effectively, a semicolon is inserted after the return statement, causing the code below it (a labeled literal inside a block) to be unreachable. This rule and the no-unreachable rule will protect your code from such cases. On the other side of the argument are those who says that since semicolons are inserted automatically, they are optional and do not need to be inserted manually. However, the ASI mechanism can also be tricky to people who don&apos;t use semicolons. For example, consider this code: In this example, a semicolon will not be inserted after the first line, causing a run-time error (because an empty object is called as if it&apos;s a function). The no-unexpected-multiline rule can protect your code from such cases. Although ASI allows for more freedom over your coding style, it can also make your code behave in an unexpected way, whether you use semicolons or not. Therefore, it is best to know when ASI takes place and when it does not, and have ESLint protect your code from these potentially unexpected cases. In short, as once described by Isaac Schlueter, a \n character always ends a statement (just like a semicolon) unless one of the following is true:</Description>
