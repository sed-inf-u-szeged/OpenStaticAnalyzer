## Reference of code duplication metrics

Code cloning (or copy-paste programming) means the copying of an existing piece of source code, pasting it somewhere else, and typically performing smaller modifications on it. Based on the level of similarity between the copied code fragments we can define the following duplication types:

- **Type-1**: the copied code parts are identical code fragments except for variations in whitespace, layout and comments.

- **Type-2**: syntactically identical fragments except for variations in identifier names, literals, type references, whitespace, layout and comments.

- **Type-3**: copied fragments with further modifications such as altered, added, or removed statements, in addition to variations in identifier names, literals, type references, whitespace, layout and comments.

- **Type-4**: the copied code fragments are syntactically different, but they perform the same functionality, i.e. they are semantically the same.

OpenStaticAnalyzer is capable of identifying Type-2 clones, i.e. code fragments that are structurally identical, but may differ in variable names, literals, identifiers, etc.

Two code segments correspond to each other if they are copies of each other. This relation is an equivalence relation and we use the notion of clone classes to the classes of the relation, and the members of the classes will be referred to as clone instances. Owing to the nature of the relation, each clone class must contain at least two clone instances.

Clones are tracked during the source code analysis of consecutive revisions of the analyzed software system. OpenStaticAnalyzer detects suspicious, inconsistently changing code copies, which are called "clone smells". The smells concerning clone classes are the following:

- **Disappearing Clone Class (DCC):** The clone class existed in the previously analyzed revision but it does not exist anymore.

- **Appearing Clone Class (ACC):** The clone class did not exist in the previously analyzed revision.

The smells concerning clone instances are issued only if the containing clone class does not contain any smell. These are the following:

- **Disappearing Clone Instance (DCI):** The clone instance existed in the previously analyzed revision but it does not exist anymore.

- **Appearing Clone Instance (ACI):** The clone instance did not exist in the previously analyzed revision.

- **Moving Clone Instance (MCI):** The clone instance belonged to a different clone class in the previously analyzed revision than its current class.

The following table summarizes the code duplication metrics, their abbreviations, and their correspondence to different source code element types.
