OpenStaticAnalyzer is a source code analyzer tool, which can perform deep
static analysis of the source code of complex software systems implemented in
Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, or C/C++ programming languages.

The source code of a program is usually its only up-to-date documentation. At
the same time, the source code is the exquisite bearer of knowledge, business
processes and methodology, accumulated over a long period of time. Source code
quality decrease, which happens due to many quick fixes and time pressure,
results in the increase of development and testing costs, and operational
risks. In spite of this, the source code usually receives hostile treatment
and is merely considered as a tool.

OpenStaticAnalyzer provides deep static analysis of source code.
Using the results of the analysis, the quality of the analyzed source code can
be improved and developed both in the short- and long term in a directed way.

Product characteristics

The most important product characteristics of OpenStaticAnalyzer are the following:
* Support for Java 11, Python 2.7.x and 3.8.x, EcmaScript2022 (JavaScript), C# 8.0, C++17
* Platform-independent command line tools
* Transparent integration into build processes
* Powerful filter management
* Coding issue detection
  - Common programming mistakes
  - Metric threshold violations
  - Integration of popular free tools (PMD, SpotBugs, Pylint, ESLint, FxCop, Cppchek, Clang-Tidy)
* Clone detection (copy-pasted source code fragments) extended with clone
  tracking and "clone smells"
  - Syntax-based, so-called Type-2 clones
* Metrics calculation at component, file, package/namespace, class, method,
  and function levels:
  - Source code metrics
  - Clone metrics
  - Coding rule violation metrics
  - Maintainability Index metrics

By continuous static analysis, the software developers can:
- reduce the software erosion rate and this way decrease development costs;
- coding problems can be identified before testing, so the number of test
  iterations and the testing costs can be reduced;
- the number of errors in delivered software can be reduced, so the
  operational risks can be decreased, increasing the company's reputation.

For more information about OpenStaticAnalyzer please read the files UsersGuide.html,
which can be found in the Java, Python, JavaScript, CSharp, and CPP subdirectories of the package.
