## Reference of source code metrics

Source code metrics are used to quantify different source code characteristics. OpenStaticAnalyzer computes source code metrics for the following source code element kinds: components (e.g. modules), source files, packages, class types, methods and functions.

The calculated metrics are grouped into 6 categories, which are the following:

- **Cohesion metrics:** measure to what extent the source code elements are coherent in the system.

- **Complexity metrics:** measure the complexity of source code elements (typically algorithms).

- **Coupling metrics:** measure the amount of interdependencies of source code elements.

- **Documentation metrics:** measure the amount of comments and documentation of source code elements in the system.

- **Inheritance metrics:** measure the different aspects of the inheritance hierarchy of the system.

- **Size metrics:** measure the basic properties of the analyzed system in terms of different cardinalities (e.g. number of code lines, number of classes or methods).

In the case of the documentation metrics all the comments found immediately before a source code element are considered as its documentation, while the comments contained inside the source code element are considered as its comments.

The following table summarizes the metrics, their abbreviations and their correspondence to different source code element kinds:

### Cohesion metrics

#### Lack of Cohesion in Methods 5 (LCOM5) {#LCOM5}

**Class:** number of functionalities of the class. One of the basic principles of object-oriented programming is encapsulation, meaning that attributes belonging together and the operations that use them should be organized into one class, and one class shall implement only one functionality, i.e. its attributes and methods should be coherent. This metric measures the lack of cohesion and computes into how many coherent classes the class could be split. It is calculated by taking a non-directed graph, where the nodes are the implemented local methods of the class and there is an edge between the two nodes if and only if a common (local or inherited) attribute or abstract method is used or a method invokes another. The value of the metric is the number of connected components in the graph not counting those, which contain only constructors.

### Complexity metrics

#### McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity (McCC) {#McCC}

**Method / Function:** complexity of the method/function expressed as the number of independent control flow paths in it. It represents a lower bound for the number of possible execution paths in the source code and at the same time it is an upper bound for the minimum number of test cases needed for achieving full branch test coverage. The value of the metric is calculated as the number of the following instructions plus 1: if, for, while, except and conditional expression. Moreover, logical “and” and logical “or” expressions also add 1 to the value because their short-circuit evaluation can cause branching depending on the first operand. The following instructions are not included: else, try, finally.

**File:** complexity of the file expressed as the number of independent control flow paths in it. It represents a lower bound for the number of possible execution paths in the source code and at the same time it is an upper bound for the minimum number of test cases needed for achieving full branch test coverage. The value of the metric is calculated as the number of the following instructions plus 1: if, for, while, except and conditional expression. Moreover, logical “and” and logical “or” expressions also add 1 to the value because their short-circuit evaluation can cause branching depending on the first operand. The following instructions are not included: else, try, finally.

#### Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) {#WMC}

**Class:** complexity of the class expressed as the number of independent control flow paths in it. It is calculated as the sum of the McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity (McCC) values of its local methods.

### Coupling metrics

#### Coupling Between Object classes (CBO) {#CBO}

**Class:** number of directly used other classes (e.g. by inheritance, function call, type reference, attribute reference).

#### Number of Outgoing Invocations (NOI) {#NOI}

**Method / Function:** number of directly called methods/functions. If a method/function is invoked several times, it is counted only once.
