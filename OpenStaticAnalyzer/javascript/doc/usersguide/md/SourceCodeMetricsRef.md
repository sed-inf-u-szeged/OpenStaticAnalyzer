## Reference of source code metrics

Source code metrics are used to quantify different source code characteristics. OpenStaticAnalyzer computes source code metrics for the following source code element kinds: components, source files, classes, methods and functions.

The calculated metrics are grouped into 4 categories, which are the following:

- **Complexity metrics:** measure the complexity of source code elements (typically algorithms).

- **Documentation metrics:** measure the amount of comments and documentation of source code elements in the system.

- **Inheritance metrics:** measure the different aspects of the inheritance hierarchy of the system.

- **Size metrics:** measure the basic properties of the analyzed system in terms of different cardinalities (e.g. number of code lines, number of classes or methods).

The following table summarizes the metrics, their abbreviations and their correspondence to different source code element kinds:

### Complexity metrics

#### McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity (McCC) {#McCC}

**Method, Function:** complexity of the method expressed as the number of independent control flow paths in it. It represents a lower bound for the number of possible execution paths in the source code and at the same time it is an upper bound for the minimum number of test cases needed for achieving full branch test coverage. The value of the metric is calculated as the number of the following instructions plus 1: if, else if, for, for...in, for...of, while, do-while, case label (which belongs to a switch instruction), catch clause, conditional expression (?:). Moreover, logical “and” (&amp;&amp;) and logical “or” (||) expressions also add 1 to the value because their short-circuit evaluation can cause branching depending on the first operand. The following instructions are not included: else, switch, try, finally.
