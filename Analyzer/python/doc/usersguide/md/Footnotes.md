[^2]: POSIX Extended Regular Expressions

[^3]: For correct calculation of the TNDI metric, the user has to
    specify which directories belong to the project with
    the -projectBaseDir parameter. Without it, "every" directory will be
    counted starting from the root, meaning that running the analysis
    from directories that are at different depths will cause the value
    of the TNDI metric to change.
